            <p>I am currently completing the software development bootcamp program with Northcoders, specialising in full stack web development. This couples with my previous career experience as a consultant electrical design engineer, working with clients and stakeholders to produce design solutions that best fit their needs.</p>

                <h2>Software principles</h2>
                <p>Having had prior coding experience using for loops and if & while statements, during the course of the bootcamp I have gained experience and confidence developing a far wider spectrum of coding tools. This includes using Node.js, developing functional programs and using asynchronous code. Much of this experience has been gained whilst pair-programming; switching between driver and navigator roles and tacking the problems at hand from different perspectives.</p>

                <h2>Back-end development</h2>
                <p>Using Node.js to run the back-end, I have built and tested RESTful APIs, allowing for CRUD operations. These servers have been built using Express and following MVC architecture.</p>

                <h2>Front-end development</h2>
                <p>Experience producing responsive web designs; primarily using React. This includes experience using the React Router, and querying APIs to provide a seamless experience for the user, such as implementing optimistic rendering where suitable.</p>

                <h2>Web development</h2>
                <p>In addition to acquiring foundational knowledge in JavaScript and implementing basic manipulation of the DOM, I have also developed skills in structuring and styling web pages with HTML and CSS. In addition, I have some introductory experience with frameworks, including Bootstrap and MUI.</p>
